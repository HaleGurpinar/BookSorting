# BookSorting - LeagueTable

## Book Sorting

Design a class called Book. Inherit from this class Comparable interface and override the "compareTo" method. Inside this method, write the code that sorts the book by name from A to Z. Create 5 objects of this class and store the objects in a Set type structure. Then use a Set type data structure a second time and have it sort the books by page count.

The Book class consists of the name of the book, the number of pages, the name of the author, and the date of publication.

## League Table

A class should be written that creates random match fixtures for teams entered with Java.

Rules : 

- Double Term League method will be applied. Each team will play two matches against other teams, at home and away.

- The left side of the list shows the home team and the right side shows the away team.

- If an odd number of teams is entered, another team named "BAY" must be added to complete the even number. Teams matching BAY means they will not play that week.
